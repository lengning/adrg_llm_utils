<h1>Protocol Description</h1>
<h1>Protocol Description</h1>
<h2>ProtocolNumberand Title</h2>
<p>Protocol Number: CDISCPILOT01</p>
<p>Protocol Title: Safety and Efficacy of the Xanomeline Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease</p>
<p>Protocol Versions:</p>
<p>The protocol was amended 3 times. For the first 2 amendments, changes were made to the ambulatory ECG assessments. Changes to the protocol-specified analyses are described in the statistical analysis plan.</p>
<h2>Protocol Designin Relation to ADaM Concepts</h2>
<h3>1) Protocol Objective</h3>
<p>The primary objectives of this study were to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose, and to document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.</p>
<h3>2) Protocol Methodology</h3>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were randomized equally to placebo, xanomeline low dose, or xanomeline high dose. Subjects applied 2 patches daily and were followed for a total of 26 weeks.</p>
<h3>3) Number of Subjects Planned in Total and by Group</h3>
<p>300 subjects total (100 subjects in each of 3 groups)</p>
<h3>4) Study Design Schema</h3>
<p>The study included three treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low dose (54 mg), and xanomeline high dose (81 mg). The treatment duration was 26 weeks, with assessments at various time points including Weeks 8, 16, and 24 for efficacy and safety evaluations.</p>

<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of this appendix is to document thetraceability ofkeyoutput analysis results with ADaM when the analysis results were generated using a legacy process.</p>
<p>Because of transformations required during ADaM conversion, some of the terms, categories and data formats used in the tabulation data have been translated into CDISC standard formats in the ADaM data.  This appendix identifies differences between the legacyanalysisand ADaM data, and explains how ADaM represents the equivalent data.</p>
<h1>Conversion Data Flow</h1>
<p>The legacy data was converted to SDTM/ADaMas described in the following data flow diagram.</p>
