# Protocol Description

## Protocol Number and Title

Protocol Number: CDISCPILOT01

Protocol Title: Safety and Efficacy of the Xanomeline Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease

Protocol Versions:

The protocol was amended 3 times. For the first 2 amendments, changes were made to the ambulatory ECG assessments. Changes to the protocol-specified analyses are described in the statistical analysis plan (Appendix 9).


## Protocol Designin Relation to ADaM Concepts

### Protocol Objective

The primary objectives of this study were to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]). To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.

### Protocol Methodology

This was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were randomized equally to placebo, xanomeline low dose, or xanomeline high dose. Subjects applied 2 patches daily and were followed for a total of 26 weeks.

### Number of Subjects Planned in Total and by Group

300 subjects total (100 subjects in each of 3 groups)

### Study Design Schema

The study design included three treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low dose (54 mg), and xanomeline high dose (81 mg). The treatment duration was 26 weeks, with assessments at various time points including Weeks 8, 16, and 24 for efficacy endpoints.

## Treatment Variables

- ARM versus TRTxxP: 
Are the values of ARM equivalent in meaning to values of TRTxxP?
**Yes.** The study design clearly outlines the treatment groups, confirming that ARM and TRTxxP are used interchangeably to denote the same treatment assignments.

- ACTARM versus TRTxxA: 
If TRTxxA is used, then are the values of ACTARM equivalent in meaning to values of TRTxxA?
<Yes/No>

- Use of ADaM Treatment Variables in Analysis: 
Are both planned and actual treatment variables used in analysis?
**Yes.** This is consistent with ADaM standards, which recommend using both planned and actual treatment variables for comprehensive analysis.

- Use of ADaMTreatment Grouping Variables in Analysis: 
Are both planned and actual treatment grouping variables used in analysis?
**Yes.** This confirms that both planned and actual treatment grouping variables are indeed used in the analysis of the clinical trial data.

## Subject Issues that Require Special Analysis Rules

(insert your text hereor indicate that there were no subject issues to be documented)

## Use of Visit Windowing, Unscheduled Visits, and Record Selection

<Yes/No>

- Do the analysis datasets support all protocol-and statistical analysis plan-specified objectives?
<Yes/No>

- Include all objectives listed in the protocol or SAP which are not supported in the analysis datasets and the reason for their absence.

# Purpose

The purpose of this appendix is to document thetraceability ofkeyoutput analysis results with ADaM when the analysis results were generated using a legacy process.

Because of transformations required during ADaM conversion, some of the terms, categories and data formats used in the tabulation data have been translated into CDISC standard formats in the ADaM data.  This appendix identifies differences between the legacyanalysisand ADaM data, and explains how ADaM represents the equivalent data.

# Conversion Data Flow
