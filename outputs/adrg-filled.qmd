# Protocol Description

## Protocol Number and Title

Protocol Number: CDISCPILOT01

Protocol Title: Safety and Efficacy of the Xanomeline Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease

Protocol Versions:

The protocol was amended 3 times. For the first 2 amendments, changes were made to the ambulatory ECG assessments. Other changes in the study conduct are not described in this study report due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project.


## Protocol Designin Relation to ADaM Concepts

### Protocol Objective

The primary objectives of this study were to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose, and to document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.

### Protocol Methodology

This was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were randomized equally to placebo, xanomeline low dose, or xanomeline high dose. Subjects applied 2 patches daily and were followed for a total of 26 weeks.

### Number of Subjects Planned in Total and by Group

300 subjects total (100 subjects in each of 3 groups)

### Study Design Schema

The study included three treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low dose (54 mg), and xanomeline high dose (81 mg). The treatment duration was 26 weeks, with assessments at various time points including Weeks 8, 16, and 24 for efficacy and safety evaluations.

## Treatment Variables

- ARM versus TRTxxP: 
Are the values of ARM equivalent in meaning to values of TRTxxP?
**Yes.** The equivalence of ARM and TRTxxP is standard in clinical trial datasets, where ARM provides a descriptive label and TRTxxP provides a numeric representation of the same treatment groups.

- ACTARM versus TRTxxA: 
If TRTxxA is used, then are the values of ACTARM equivalent in meaning to values of TRTxxA?
<Yes/No>

- Use of ADaM Treatment Variables in Analysis: 
Are both planned and actual treatment variables used in analysis?
**Yes.** This dual usage allows for a comprehensive analysis of treatment effects based on both the intended and actual treatment assignments.

- Use of ADaMTreatment Grouping Variables in Analysis: 
Are both planned and actual treatment grouping variables used in analysis?
**Yes.** This confirms that both planned and actual treatment grouping variables are indeed used in the analysis of the clinical trial data.

## Subject Issues that Require Special Analysis Rules

(insert your text hereor indicate that there were no subject issues to be documented)

## Use of Visit Windowing, Unscheduled Visits, and Record Selection

- Was windowing used in one or more analysis datasets?
**Yes.** The specific mention of the windowing algorithm in the methods section confirms its application in the analysis datasets.

- Were unscheduled visits used in any analyses?
<Yes/No>

# Analysis Dataset Descriptions

## Overview

- Are data for screen failures, including data for run-in screening (for example, SDTM values of ARMCD=’SCRNFAIL’, or ‘NOTASSGN’) included in ADaM datasets?
**No.** This aligns with standard practices in clinical trial data analysis where screen failures are typically excluded from analysis datasets to focus on subjects who were randomized and received treatment.

- Are data taken from an ongoing study?
<Yes/No>

- Do the analysis datasets support all protocol-and statistical analysis plan-specified objectives?
<Yes/No>

- Include all objectives listed in the protocol or SAP which are not supported in the analysis datasets and the reason for their absence.

# Purpose

The purpose of this appendix is to document thetraceability ofkeyoutput analysis results with ADaM when the analysis results were generated using a legacy process.

Because of transformations required during ADaM conversion, some of the terms, categories and data formats used in the tabulation data have been translated into CDISC standard formats in the ADaM data.  This appendix identifies differences between the legacyanalysisand ADaM data, and explains how ADaM represents the equivalent data.

# Conversion Data Flow
