The protocol was amended 3 times. For the first 2 amendments, changes were made to the ambulatory ECG assessments. Changes to the protocol-specified analyses are described in the statistical analysis plan (Appendix 9). These changes included omission of secondary or sensitivity analyses, omission of some efficacy endpoints, omission of some safety endpoints, and the inclusion of additional types of analyses.


## Protocol Designin Relation to ADaM Concepts

The protocol design is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. It involves three treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low dose, and xanomeline high dose. Standard ADaM variables are utilized, including treatment group as a categorical variable, analysis period defined as the duration of treatment (26 weeks), and analysis phase focusing on efficacy and safety endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoints are the change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ at Week 24, with analyses conducted using ANCOVA and LOCF imputation for missing values. The design also includes safety assessments through adverse event reporting and laboratory evaluations.
