## Protocol Designin Relation to ADaM Concepts

### Protocol Objective

The primary objectives of this study were to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]). To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.

### Protocol Methodology

This was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were randomized equally to placebo, xanomeline low dose, or xanomeline high dose. Subjects applied 2 patches daily and were followed for a total of 26 weeks.

### Number of Subjects Planned in Total and by Group

300 subjects total (100 subjects in each of 3 groups)

### Study Design Schema

The study design included three treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low dose (54 mg), and xanomeline high dose (81 mg). The treatment duration was 26 weeks, with assessments at various time points including Weeks 8, 16, and 24 for efficacy endpoints.
