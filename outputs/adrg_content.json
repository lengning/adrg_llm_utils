  "date_imputation_rules": "**Date Imputation Rules:**\n\n- **Algorithm to derive ADAE.ASTDT**: AE.AESTDTC, converted to a numeric SAS date. Some events with partial dates are imputed in a conservative manner. If the day component is missing, a value of '01' is used. If both the month and day are missing no imputation is performed as these dates clearly indicate a start prior to the beginning of treatment. There are no events with completely missing start dates.\n\n- **Algorithm to derive ADAE.ASTDTF**: ASTDTF='D' if the day value within the character date is imputed. Note that only day values needed to be imputed for this study.",
